\noindent{\bf 1.} $$X \sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda=\frac1{244})$$

\noindent{\bf 2.} $$F_X(50) \approx 0.185285906482$$

\noindent{\bf 3.} I disagree with that statement because the exponential distribution is memoryless.

\noindent{\bf 4.} I'm assuming that earthquakes occur at a constant rate over time, and that earthquakes are independent of each other. I'm pretty shaky on this, but I vaguely remember learning that during periods without earthquakes, tectonic plates build up tension over time, making earthquakes more and more likely. Thus, I would expect my probability to be an underestimate.
